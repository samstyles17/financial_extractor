Material Topic,TCS’ Approach
"Board effectiveness,",Board effectiveness is enhanced by setting a high bar in selecting the right mix of individuals to
independence and protection,"serve on the Board, with the right qualifications, expertise and experience, who can collectively"
of minority shareholders’,"serve the best interests of all stakeholders, maintain board and management accountability"
interests,"and drive corporate ethics, values and sustainability. Profiles of Board of Directors are available"
"",at https://www.tcs.com/ir-corporate-governance.
"","For greater diversity of opinions and perspectives within the Board, the Nomination and"
"","Remuneration Committee2 has fostered diversity in terms of backgrounds, areas of expertise"
"",and:
"",•  Gender: Two (22.2 per cent) of the nine Directors are women.
"","•  Nationality: Three nationalities represented – Indian, American and Danish."
"","•  Industry: Technology, Banking, Energy, Transportation and Academia."
Material Topic,TCS’ Approach
"",TCS’ policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at
"",https://on.tcs.com/appointment-BoD.
"","Board independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent"
"","directors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent. None of the independent directors is related to each other,"
"",or to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.
"",Board effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds
"","directorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as"
"",an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities.
"",TCS’ governance philosophy around minority shareholders’ interests is guided by the TCoC
"","which emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse"
"",and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders’ interests are protected.
"","TCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures"
"","and detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and"
"",material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured
"","global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the"
"",management or the Board.
"",Shareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary’s office
"","through a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders’"
"",Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.
Avoidance of conflict of,"Chairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief"
interest3,Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD).
"","TCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses"
"","covering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any"
"","employee – including the executive directors – from accepting any position of responsibility,"
"","with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS’ prior written approval."
"","For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board."
"Values, Ethics and compliance6","Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and"
"",has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global
"","business. The Company’s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual,"
"","Excellence, and Learning and Sharing."
"",The TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate
"","citizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights,"
"","prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees’ freedom of association, and"
"",avoidance of conflicts of interest.
"",Every employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based
"","annual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further,"
"","frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the company values"
"",and the TCoC.
"","Customers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through"
"",inclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.
"",Employees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical
"","behaviour. They can raise ethics concerns on Ultimatix – the intranet portal of the Company,"
"",which are investigated and tracked to closure by the HR department. Employees and other
"",stakeholders can also report any non  - compliance to the TCoC or to the laws of the land by
"",senior executives directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee under the Whistle blower
"",Policy without fear of retaliation. Information about these channels is communicated to
"",employees as part of the mandatory training modules.
Material Topic,TCS’ Approach,
"","Compliance to laws of the countries in which we operate, as well as global legislation such asForeign Corrupt Practices Act, Bribery Act, 2010, etc. are monitored through formal complianceprocedures led by the Corporate compliance office. Changes to legislation are closelymonitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations.Governance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer,Chief Risk Officer and the Chief HR Officer who report to the Chief Operating Officer andExecutive Director (COO and ED), and CEO and MD respectively. At the apex level, the AuditCommittee headed by an Independent Director oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Briberyand Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and also to the external regulations.",
Tax Strategy7,"TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to therespective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner.TCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purposeof gaining tax advantages. TCS’s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives whereavailable, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of thetax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through arobust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizingthe tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, byitself or by its employees or vendors.TCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authoritiesworldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on theproposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.",
"Board Oversight ofSustainability Matters8","TCS’ approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business bycreating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliersand local communities, while also valuing the environment.

Succession planning,"TCS’ philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and anorganization structure that devolves executive decision-making across the three businessgroups (viz., Relationship Incubation group, Enterprise Growth group and BusinessTransformation group) have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent thatenables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Successionplanning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by seniormanagement. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for keyfunctions within their units.Succession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unitheads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering anopportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.",

"stewardship. To curb emissions and limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-"
"industrial levels, all organizations will have to reimagine existing business models and aim for sustainable growth. We are in a"
"unique position to combine our purpose-driven world view with digital innovation to not only drive our own sustainability, but"
"also partner with customers, civil society and governments to lead and shape solutions for a sustainable future,”"
"At the core of TCS’ strategy to reduce its carbon footprint is increased use of renewable sources of energy, and improved"
energy efficiency. The company’s strategy for the latter includes addition of more green buildings to the company’s real estate
"portfolio, reduction of IT system power usage, and the use of TCS Clever EnergyTM, which leverages IoT, machine learning and AI"
to optimize energy consumption across campuses. TCS’ Vision 25x25 is a strategic lever that delinks TCS’ business growth from
campus expansion and brings down emissions related to employee commutes and business travel.
"Environmental targets and achievements are part of Natural Capital section, which is a part of Integrated Annual Report."

Provident fund
"In accordance with Indian law, all eligible employees of Tata Consultancy Services Limited in India are entitled to receive benefits"
under the provident fund plan in which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to a trust set
up by the Company to manage the investments and distribute the amounts entitled to employees. This plan is a defined benefit
"plan as the Company is obligated to provide its members a rate of return which should, at the minimum, meet the interest"
rate declared by Government administered provident fund. A part of the Company’s contribution is transferred to Government
"administered pension fund. The contributions made by the Company and the shortfall of interest, if any, are recognised as"
an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses. In accordance with an actuarial valuation of provident fund
"liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by Actuarial Society of India and based on the assumptions as mentioned below, there"
is no deficiency in the interest cost as the present value of the expected future earnings of the fund is greater than the expected
amount to be credited to the individual members based on the expected guaranteed rate of interest of Government administered
provident fund.
All eligible employees of Indian subsidiaries of the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund plan in
which both the employee and employer (at a determined rate) contribute monthly to the Government administered provident
fund plan. A part of the company’s contribution is transferred to Government administered pension fund. This plan is a defined
contribution plan as the obligation of the employer is limited to the monthly contributions made to the fund. The contributions
made to the fund are recognised as an expense in profit and loss under employee benefit expenses.

• Interest rate risk
"The Company’s investments are primarily in fixed rate interest bearing investments. Hence, the Company is not"
significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty failure to repay or service debt according to the
"contractual terms or obligations. Credit risk encompasses of both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of"
creditworthiness as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of
customers on a continuous basis to whom the credit has been granted after obtaining necessary approvals for credit.
"Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of trade receivables, loans,"
"investments, derivative financial instruments, cash and cash equivalents, bank deposits and other financial assets. Bank"
"deposits include an amount of `2,428 crore held with three banks having high credit rating which is individually in excess"
"of 10% or more of the Company’s total bank deposits as at March 31, 2023. None of the other financial instruments of the"
Company result in material concentration of credit risk.
• Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets and contract assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum
"exposure to credit risk was `90,655 crore and `90,388 crore as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, being the"
"total of the carrying amount of balances with banks, bank deposits, investments excluding equity and preference"
"investments, trade receivables, loans, contract assets and other financial assets."
The Company’s exposure to customers is diversified and no single customer contributes to more than 10% of
"outstanding trade receivable and contract assets as at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022."
• Geographic concentration of credit risk
Geographic concentration of trade receivables (gross and net of allowances) and contract assets is as follows:
"As at March 31, 2023 As at March 31, 2022"

Current regulation,"TCS is required to follow all the environmental regulations around emissions, water discharge, waste recyclingetc. Compliance to these regulations is monitored as part of the company’s risk management function andintegrated into its mitigation plans. TCS discloses its performance against various environmental parametersas per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandated Business Responsibility & SustainabilityReporting (BRSR) framework, which is a part of this Integrated Annual Report."
Emerging regulation,"Emerging regulations including carbon taxes (coal or fossil fuel taxes leading to escalation in the electricitytariff), mandatory energy audits are examples which impact TCS. Regulations around procurement ofrenewable energy, which is a key driver of the company’s climate change mitigation plan, is also ever evolvingin all major geographies. TCS keeps a close watch on the emerging regulations and plans its organizationalsustainability strategy and roadmap to adapt to those changes."
Technology,"With more energy efficient and eco-friendly building and IT equipment coming in the market, keeping TCSoffices eco-efficient is an ongoing process wherein the company evaluates the technology and suitability andworks on a phaseout plan to move to the new more efficient technology. These are considered as operationalrisks and opportunities which drive the company to make its infrastructure more climate resilient. Additionally,TCS is one of the market leaders in the cloud migration opportunity, helping clients migrate their workloadsfrom owned data centers to hyperscaler clouds, significantly reducing the carbon footprint associated withthose workloads."
Legal,"TCS tracks environmental legal compliance (air emissions, water discharges, waste management and others)on a periodic basis and has a robust internal compliance management system to identify and comply with alllegal requirements of current, amended and new regulations."
Market,"Climate change is driving a lot of changes in TCS’ customer behaviour, thus creating new markets and newopportunities, giving the company an opportunity to partner with them in their climate change mitigationjourney by providing solutions, services, and process automation which helps in emission reduction."
Reputation,"Reputational risk is relevant to the company as the investor and customer community is becoming increasinglyaware of climate change related issues. It is important to demonstrate leadership in climate action to maintainTCS’ reputation."
Acute physical,"Acute physical risks associated with extreme weather events is relevant as TCS has substantial operations incoastal cities in India which are exposed to potential extreme weather events like heavy precipitation, flood,and cyclones. E.g., The company offices located in coastal cities like Chennai, Bhubaneshwar, Kolkata, Kochi areexposed to physical risks from cyclonic events and therefore adequate mitigation plans are in place."
Chronic physical,"Having presence in many major cities across the world, TCS is subject to climate change related chronicphysical impacts like change in precipitation pattern, with resultant effects like drought or flood. Also, withTCS’s presence in coastal cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Kochi, Trivandrum, Kolkata, rise in sea level and relatedimpacts like land submergence, salt water intrusion, disruption to network and communication systems aremore likely. These risks are long term and included from perspective of planning appropriate infrastructure."
"",Have climate-related,Description of influence
"",risks and opportunities,
"",influenced your,
"",strategy in this area?,
Products and,Yes,"As TCS’ customers respond to climate change actions, the company is seeing"
services,,opportunities to provide technology-led solutions to help them achieve their
"",,sustainability goals. The change in technology consumption reflects the prevailing
"",,"trends in the economy. Recent events have accelerated digital adoption, put"
"",,the spotlight on supply chain resilience and added urgency to the sustainability
"",,imperative.
"",,Each of these represents an opportunity that can contribute towards the growth of
"",,"not just as one company, but of the ecosystem as a whole. TCS leveraged its deep"
"",,"expertise in IoT, advanced analytics, and machine learning to come up with a suite of"
"",,"offerings in this space, including intellectual property such as Clever EnergyTM, IP2TM,"
"",,and TCS EnvirozoneTM.
"",,"Clients across industries such as retail, manufacturing, utilities and consumer goods"
"",,are engaging TCS to develop innovative technology led solutions to reduce energy
"",,"consumption, or to measure and track green-house gas emissions across their end-to-"
"",,"end supply chain, reduce their carbon footprint, reduce waste and promote recycling."
Supply chain and/or,Yes,Supply Chain sustainability through responsible sourcing is one of the risk mitigations
value chain,,identified by the Company under its sustainability risk. TCS’s Green Procurement policy
"",,outlines its commitment to making its supply chain more responsible and sustainable.
"",,Energy efficiency is one of the major procurement considerations in all the company’s
"",,IT and other infrastructure assets procurement as this is directly correlated with TCS’
"",,emission profile.
"",,Climate related risks play a very important role in the company’s supply chain
"",,"engagements, and TCS is working with its suppliers to bring in improvements in"
"",,carbon performance along with other ESG elements.
Investment in R&D,Yes,TCS’ investments in research and innovation have resulted in solutions like
"",,"EnvirozoneTM, Clever Energy and IP2TM. TCS has been using Clever Energy for the last"
"",,few years to reduce its energy consumption and is now offering these to clients to
"",,"help them achieve their sustainability goals. Additionally, TCS has been investing in"
"",,building green campuses (IGBC certified).
Operations,Yes,Climate Change risks play an important consideration in TCS’ operations. The
"",,company has created an environmentally sustainable approach by creating green
"",,"policies, processes, frameworks, and infrastructure. TCS’ campuses are designed"
"",,to withstand extreme weather events and the business continuity plans are tested
"",,"periodically to ensure continued operations without any disruption. Green buildings,"
"",,"efficient operations, green IT, the use of renewable energy to reduce carbon"
"",,footprint; adoption of newer technologies and methods to manage waste in line
"",,with circular economy principles are integral to the company operations. All these
"",,initiatives are helping TCS achieve its Net Zero target by 2030.
"","Have climate-relatedrisks and opportunitiesinfluenced yourstrategy in this area?",Description of influence
"Direct costs, Capitalexpenditures, Capitalallocation, Assets",Yes,"TCS has aligned its current systems of internal financial control with the requirementof Companies Act 2013, on the lines of the globally accepted risk-based frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the TreadwayCommission.The Internal Control – Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended toincrease transparency and accountability in an organization’s process of designingand implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a companyto identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The company hassuccessfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.Climate risks and opportunities are the key factors while making financialconsiderations especially while making investments in offices, equipment, andrenewable energy. Investment in these areas constitutes a substantial share of thecompany’s overall capital investment. Major investments are in green buildings, rooftop solar and other energy efficiency initiatives. In FY 2023 TCS has invested ₹3,063crore in projects to improve environmental and social impacts. These investments,along with other mitigation steps, helped the company reduce its Scope 1 and 2emissions by 71% from base year 2016. These initiatives also help the company toposition itself as a leader in the climate domain contributing to TCS’ market value."
"Climate relatedscenario","Parameters, assumptions, analytical choices"
"Transition scenariosIEA B2DS","The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS takes a multi-level approach to identify climate riskand opportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-downanalysis of the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included a) natureloss and ecological degradation, b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation, c) changing customerand workforce preferences, d) the rise of extreme weather, e) increasing regulations, pricing and disclosure ofexternalities, f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and g) rising incomes.Detailed analysis was conducted of material climate change transition risks and opportunities across valuechain and assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities including identificationof areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities.The key value drivers analysis assesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chainincluding a) Supply Chain (input supplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs,operating costs, insurance/ damage costs due to disruption of operation) and c) End markets (demand for lowcarbon services/ products, market share and competition). In the transition scenario, the IEA B2DS approachhas been selected as its more conservative scenario. The inputs included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGsand Government of India plan on energy efficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysisalso considered the anticipated growth of TCS over the years and increased energy demand.Changing customer behavior and carbon costs are assessed as a transition risk to TCS with a growing numberof jurisdictions at regional and national level planning to implement a carbon tax or emission trading scheme."
"Physical climatescenarios RCP 8.5","The climate change scenario analysis conducted for TCS had a multi-level approach to identify climate risk andopportunity hot spots, interdependencies, and interaction with global macro trends. The top-down analysisof the macro environmental trends that will impact the company at global level included a) nature loss andecological degradation, b) resource scarcity and driving value chain innovation, c) changing customer andworkforce preferences, d) the rise of extreme weather, e) increasing regulations, pricing and disclosure ofexternalities, f) digitalization and prevalence of infectious diseases and g) rising incomes.Detailed analysis was conducted on a) material climate change physical risks and opportunities acrossvalue chain, and b)assessment of interdependencies between climate risks and opportunities includingidentification of areas of potential magnification and hedge opportunities. The key value drivers’ analysisassesses climate risks and opportunities across 3 stages of the value chain including a) Supply Chain (inputsupplies costs, disruption and access to supplies) b) Operations (carbon costs, operating costs, insurance/damage costs due to disruption of operation) & c) End Markets (demand for low carbon services/ products,market share and competition).The physical risk is assessed using the RCP 8.5 scenario. The RCP 8.5 scenario takes a global warming between3-4 degrees above pre-industrial levels which is a conservative scenario and helps us understand the worst-case climate impacts on our operations.Inputs for the assessment included IPCC reports, the NDCs, the SDGs and Government of India plan on energyefficiency and solar energy. The assumptions used in the analysis also considered the anticipated growth ofTCS over the years and increased energy demand.Few strategies to mitigate physical risks of climate change include -1) A robust Business Continuity Plan (BCP) to respond to climate events.2) Investments in climate resilient infrastructure (for cyclone, floods)."
